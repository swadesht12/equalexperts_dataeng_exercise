## Before you start
### Why complete this task?

We want to make the interview process as simple and stress-free as possible. That’s why we ask you to complete 
the first stage of the process from the comfort of your own home.

Your submission will help us to learn about your skills and approach. If we think you’re a good fit for our 
network, we’ll use your submission in the next interview stages too.

### About the task

You’ll be creating an ingestion process to ingest files containing vote data. You’ll also create a means to 
query the ingested data to determine outlier weeks.

There’s no time limit for this task, but we expect it to take less than 2 hours.

### Setup Instructions

For instructions on how to set up and run the exercise, please see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

### Tips on what we’re looking for


* ✅  **Test coverage**

    Your solution must have good test coverage, including common execution paths.

* ✅  **Self-contained tests**

    Your tests should be self-contained, with no dependency on being run in a specific order.

* ✅  **Simplicity**

    We value simplicity as an architectural virtue and a development practice. Solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and shouldn’t be overly complex. We prefer simple, well tested solutions over clever solutions. 

    Please avoid:

   * ❌ unnecessary layers of abstraction
   * ❌ patterns
   * ❌ custom test frameworks
   * ❌ architectural features that aren’t called for
   * ❌ libraries like **pandas** or **polars** or frameworks like **PySpark** or **ballista**
  
     We know that this exercise can be
     solved fairly trivially using these libraries and a Dataframe approach, and we'd encourage appropriate 
     use of these in daily work contexts. But for this small exercise we really 
     want to know more about how you structure, write and test your Python code,
     and want you to show some fluency in SQL -- a **pandas**
     solution won't allow us to see much of that.

* ✅  **Self-explanatory code**

    The solution you produce must speak for itself. Multiple paragraphs explaining the solution is a sign 
    that the code isn’t straightforward enough to understand on its own.
    However, please do explain your non-obvious _choices_ e.g. perhaps why you decided to load
    data a specific way.

* ✅ **Demonstrate fluency with data engineering concepts**
   
   Even though this is a toy exercise, treat DuckDB as you would an OLAP 
   data warehouse. Choose datatypes, data loading methods, optimisations and data models that 
   are suited for resilient analytics processing at scale, not transaction processing.

* ✅ **Dealing with ambiguity**

    If there’s any ambiguity, please add this in a section at the bottom of the README. 
    You should also make a choice to resolve the ambiguity and proceed.

Our review process starts with a very simplistic test set in the `tests/exercise_tests` folder which you should also
check before submission. You can run these with:
```shell
poetry run exercise check-ingestion
poetry run exercise check-outliers
```

Expect these to fail until you have completed the exercise.

You should not change the `tests/exercise-tests` folder and your solution should be able to pass both tests.


## Download the dataset for the exercise
Run the command
```
poetry run exercise fetch-data
```

which will fetch the dataset, uncompress it and place it in `uncommitted/votes.jsonl` for you.
Explore the data to see what values and fields it contains (no need to show how you explored it).

## Begin the two-part challenge
There are two parts to the exercise, and you are expected to complete both. 
A user should be able to execute each task independently of the other. 
For example, ingestion shouldn't cause the outliers query to be executed.

### Part 1: Ingestion
Create a schema called `blog_analysis`.
Create an ingestion process that can be run on demand to ingest files containing vote data. 
You should ensure that data scientists, who will be consumers of the data, do not need to consider 
duplicate records in their queries. The data should be stored in a table called `votes` in the `blog_analysis` schema. 

### Part 2: Outliers calculation
Create a view named `outlier_weeks`  in the `blog_analysis` schema. It will contain the output of a SQL calculation for which weeks are regarded as outliers based on the vote data that was ingested.
The view should contain the year, week number and the number of votes for the week _for only those weeks which are determined to be outliers_, according to the following rule:

NB! If you're viewing this Markdown document in a viewer
where the math isn't rendering, try viewing this README in GitHub on your web browser, or [see this pdf](docs/calculating_outliers.pdf).

> 
> **A week is classified as an outlier when the total votes for the week deviate from the average votes per week for the complete dataset by more than 20%.**</br>  
> For the avoidance of doubt, _please use the following formula_: 
>  
> > Say the mean votes is given by $\bar{x}$ and this specific week's votes is given by $x_i$. 
> > We want to know when $x_i$ differs from $\bar{x}$ by more than $20$%. 
> > When this is true, then the ratio $\frac{x_i}{\bar{x}}$ must be further from $1$ by more than $0.2$, i.e.: </br></br> 
> > $\big|1 - \frac{x_i}{\bar{x}}\big| > 0.2$

The data should be sorted in the view by year and week number, with the earliest week first.

Running `outliers.py` should recreate the view and 
just print the contents of this `outlier_weeks` view to the terminal - don't do any more calculations after creating the view.

## Example

The sample dataset below is included in the test-resources folder and can be used when creating your tests.

Assuming a file is ingested containing the following entries:

```
{"Id":"1","PostId":"1","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-02T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"2","PostId":"1","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-09T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"4","PostId":"1","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-09T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"5","PostId":"1","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-09T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"6","PostId":"5","VoteTypeId":"3","CreationDate":"2022-01-16T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"7","PostId":"3","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-16T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"8","PostId":"4","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-16T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"9","PostId":"2","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-23T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"10","PostId":"2","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-23T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"11","PostId":"1","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-30T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"12","PostId":"5","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-01-30T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"13","PostId":"8","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-02-06T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"14","PostId":"13","VoteTypeId":"3","CreationDate":"2022-02-13T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"15","PostId":"13","VoteTypeId":"3","CreationDate":"2022-02-20T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"16","PostId":"11","VoteTypeId":"2","CreationDate":"2022-02-20T00:00:00.000"}
{"Id":"17","PostId":"3","VoteTypeId":"3","CreationDate":"2022-02-27T00:00:00.000"}
```

Then the following should be the content of your `outlier_weeks` view:


| Year | WeekNumber | VoteCount |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 2022 | 0          | 1         |
| 2022 | 1          | 3         |
| 2022 | 2          | 3         |
| 2022 | 5          | 1         |
| 2022 | 6          | 1         |
| 2022 | 8          | 1         |

**Note that we strongly encourage you to use this data as a test case to ensure that you have the correct calculation!**

## Follow-up Questions

Please include instructions about your strategy and important decisions you made in the README file. You should also include answers to the following questions, please make sure these are answered without the use AI tools as we would like to understand your thought process:

1. What kind of data quality measures would you apply to your solution in production?
2. What would need to change for the solution scale to work with a 10TB dataset with 5GB new data arriving each day?
3. Please tell us in your modified README about any assumptions you have made in your solution (below).


## Your Approach and answers to follow-up questions 

_Please provide an explaination to your implementation approach and the additional questions **here**_

## AI Tool Usage
